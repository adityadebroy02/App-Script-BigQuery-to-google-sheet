Script to get data from BigQuery tables to Google SpreadSheet

If you are getting data from a view instead 
then try to schedule the query - it will create a table, instead of view 
then pull the data from that table 
* Note the above approach solved my error of using view 
if you have any other solution which works for you then let me know
